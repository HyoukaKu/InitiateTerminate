How To Use
-----------

Config file : `Delay, Start_command and Stop_command`
#### pretty much self explained the delay delays the start command in seconds (stop command should be executed right away after stop), just change the delay to what you prefer and the commands to something you need.
_____
made it since I needed a plugin to tell me when the server starts and gets off so it messages me in discord whenever the server stops or starts (even if its a crash)
